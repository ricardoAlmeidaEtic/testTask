TEST TASK:
        This is a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The
        program maintains a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder.
        
        >Synchronization is one-way: after the synchronization content of the
        replica folder is modified to exactly match content of the source
        folder;
        
        >Synchronization is performed periodically.
        
        >File creation/copying/removal operations are logged to a file and to the
        console output;
        
        >Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path are provided
        using the command line arguments;
